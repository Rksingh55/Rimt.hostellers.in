                RIMT CAMPUS IS RENOWNED AS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND DYNAMIC PLACES AND IS VIRTUALLY OUT OF
                CITY
                . THE HOSTEL RESIDENCES SIT AT THE BASE OF GREENS, MILES AWAY IN SERENITY YET CLOSE TO
                CIVILISATION.
                THEY ARE SPACES FOR LIVING AND LEARNING.
                YOU CAN CHOOSE TO LIVE IN A APARTMENT. EVERY ACCOMMODATION IS FULLY FURNISHED.
                YOUR
                DAY-TO-DAY COMFORTS ARE WELL TAKEN CARE OF. OUR ROOMS ARE SPACIOUS, WELL-LIT AND AIRY.
                ALL STANDARD MEDICAL FACILITIES ARE AVAILABLE WITHIN THE CAMPUS AND IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY,
                THERE ARE
                PROVISIONS TO RUSH TO THE NEAREST HEALTHCARE FACILITY.
                THERE ARE SPECIAL ACCESSIBLE PLACES IN THE ROOMS AND HALLS FOR STUDENTS.

                At RIMT our entire focus is on giving you a home environment away from your home with the only
                difference that at home you live with your biological family, but in an RIMT hostel, you live
                with
                the family of your roommates.

                There is round-the-clock high-tech security, to begin with. Once you start living inside the
                RIMT
                campus, you are as safe as you are at home, in fact, more. We have hired one of the best
                security
                agencies to keep our students safe. Every nook and corner of the campus is illuminated at night.
                There are CCTV cameras installed while taking full care of the privacy concerns of our students.

                During your stay at the RIMT hostel, you will be interacting with students whose native language
                and
                way of life will be different than yours. In a globally connected world, after all, your work
                environment is going to consist of people from all over the world hence.
